## Getting Started

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- `node` (v20.15.0). We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your node versions. Once you have `nvm` installed, run `nvm install v20.15.0` to install node. Then use [avn](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) to automatically switch to the correct node version when you enter the project directory.
- `yarn`

Install the necessary dependencies via:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
make devserver
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
